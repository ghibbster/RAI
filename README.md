 RAI stands for Regression Automata Identifier, a program meant for learning automata over infinite alphabets, or at least too large to enumerate.Regression Automata are generic models intended for regression, with transitions constrained by intervals over the alphabet. The algorithm is based on the Red \& Blue framework for learning from an input sample.
